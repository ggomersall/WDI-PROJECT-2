# DeskBrews - WDI-16 Project-2

###DeskBrews
####Why DeskBrews? 

One of my goals when choosing project 2 for WDI, was to learn how to use payment methods, one in particular Stripe, as I feel they are the fastest growing merchant provider and one of the easiest to implement (as I learnt during the development of this app).

I wanted to create an app that will allow users to sign up and be able to order a product online within a few simple steps, and incorporate a seemless payment integration as well.

The intended audience is mainly for companies wanting to end a productive week with their staff, as well as saying a special thanks for their hardwork (and maybe even to help inspire new ideas for the following week) by sharing a beer or two in the office, hence the name DeskBrews.

The app is responsive, thanks to the use of bootstrap, and the payment process with stripe is mobile formatted as well, so it's easy enough to use on a phone or ipad.

##Improvements / future review
If I had had a couple more days, I would have liked to improve the mobile version of the app to have a bottom navbar, with icons rather than the outdated burger menu.
<br> 

I would have also liked to have made the redirection upon successful purchase or adding of addresses to redirect the user to the relevant tabs on the account page.
<br> 

As well as a basic ordering of beers for a specific date, I would like to revist this app to setup a subscription service, so that a user may subscribe to a weekly, fortnightly or monthly delivery service. 
<br> 

I would also like to incorporate a social aspect for, either using twitter or instagram, where users can share their experience of the delivery, i.e. "@deskbrews thanks for the #fridaybeers!"
